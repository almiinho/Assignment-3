# Assignment-3

The "MyLinkedListQueue" constructor initializes an instance of MyLinkedList to store the elements of the queue.

The "enqueue" method adds an element to the back of the queue using the "addLast" method of the underlying MyLinkedList.

The "dequeue" method removes and returns the element at the front of the queue using the "removeFirst" method of the underlying MyLinkedList. 

If the queue is empty, it throws an EmptyStackException.
The "peek" method returns the element at the front of the queue using the "getFirst" method of the underlying MyLinkedList, but does not remove it. 

If the queue is empty, it throws an EmptyStackException.

The "size" method returns the number of elements in the queue using the size method of the underlying MyLinkedList.

The "isEmpty" method returns true if the queue is empty and false otherwise by using the isEmpty method of the underlying MyLinkedList.
